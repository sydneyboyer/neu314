#Write a function that takes as input a string representing the filename, and
#then loads the image file, displays it, and extracts the red, blue, and green
#channels into separate variables, and returns those variables.
#In other words, your function should take an image name as an argument and output
# three separate variables, that in the case of our example image would each be a
#360x640 matrix. Commit and push your file to the repository you just set up.

#Let’s say you think you can optimize this function in some way,
#but accidentally break it. Simulate this by adding println("BUG BUG BUG")
#somewhere in the code (and adding whatever else you want).
#Commit and push your “buggy” file to the repository you just set up.

#Let’s say you think you can optimize this function in some way,

#Simulate this by adding println("BUG BUG BUG") somewhere in the code (and adding whatever else you want).
#Stage and commit your “buggy” file.




#Now, using version control commands in GitKraken,
#perform a git reset --mixed to undo your commit and delete the lines you added to get a “bug-free” version of your code.
# Also add the line println("Reset with git reset --mixed"). Think about whether this was real buggy code --
#what would be the value of this reset?
